### prcl - `C` source code with intelligent line numbers

Many documents have code extracts with line numbers on the left of the lines
that are referred to in the text. 
[W.Rich Stevens' texts on TCP/IP and Network Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Richard_Stevens#Books) are good examples.

In many cases I suspect the line numbers are generated by `pr(1)` or `cat(1)` with 
and the numbers manually removed from the uninteresting lines.
I wondered whether a simple program could do a little better.


`Prcl` is a small program that prepends line numbers to *interesting* lines
in C source code for the purposes of documentation etc.
*Uninteresting* lines such as blank lines, line containing only
comments, strings and punctuation do not have their line numbers printed.
A selection of keywords appearing on a line with only other uninteresting
symbols are also deemed uninteresting.

#### EXAMPLE


     $ ./prcl example.c

         [example.c]
         /*
         //    @(#) example.c
         */
     4    # include    &lt;stdio.h&gt;
          //    C++ style comment
     6    main (int argc, char* argv[]) {
     7        if (argc &lt; 4) {
     8            switch (argc) {
     9            case    1:
    10                printf ("Hello!\n");
                  break;
    12            case    2:
    13                printf ("Hello %s!\n", argv[1]);
                  break;
    15            case    3:
    16                printf ("Hello %s and %s!\n", argv[1], argv[2]);
                  break;
                  }
              }
              else    {
    21             printf ("Hello all!\n");
              }
         }

#### PREREQUISITES

Only requires the standard C [89] library so
so can build with just  

     cc -o prcl prcl.c

#### BUGS
This program has no knowledge of C syntax or preprocessor constructions
so erroneous C code and clever macros will likely break it.
What constitutes an uninteresting keyword is a matter of taste but
can be add or subtracted from the **BORING[]** table in the program's source.

Pr(1) - `pr -n 8` will print numbers against every line.

Indent(1) is a C beautfier and source code reformatter that probably can
do intelligent line numbering if you can locate the correct switches
